--1st query was to get a more clear view of the data


	SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
Order By 1,2


--2nd was to look at total cases vs. total deaths


	SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, 
  		(total_deaths / total_cases) * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
Order By 1,2


--3rd was to look at total cases vs. population


	SELECT location, date, population, total_cases,
 		(total_cases / population) * 100 AS percentage_of_populaton_got_covid
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
WHERE location = 'United States'
Order By 1,2
 
 
--4th was to look at countries with highest infection rate compared to population


	SELECT 
  		location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infection_count,
MAX((total_cases / population)) * 100 AS percentage_population_infected
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
GROUP BY location, population
Order By percentage_population_infected DESC 
 
 
--5th was to look at countries with highest death count per population


	SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths as int)) AS total_death_count
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
Order By total_death_count DESC 


--6th Query was to continents with the highest death count


	SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths as int)) AS total_death_count
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NULL
GROUP BY location
Order By total_death_count DESC 
 
 
--The Following queries are to look at global numbers
 
--7th Query was to look at the global total cases and deaths per day as well as the global death percentage per day


SELECT 
  	date, SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases_per_date,
 		SUM(new_deaths) AS total_deaths_per_date,
  	(SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)) * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY date
Order By 1, 2


--8th Query was similar, here I just looked at the total global cases, deaths and the death percentage


	SELECT 
  		SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases_per_date,
  		SUM(new_deaths) AS total_deaths_per_date,
  		(SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)) * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
Order By 1, 2
 
 
--9th query was to join the covid deaths and vaccination tables to just to check if the join was working correctly


SELECT 
  		*
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` dea 
JOIN `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_vaccinations` vac
  		ON dea.location = vac.location
  		AND dea.date = vac.date

 
--10th query was to look at vaccination numbers based on location, here I added a rolling count to tally the daily vaccinations per location.


SELECT 
  		dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
  		SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location order by dea.location,
   		dea.date) AS rolling_vaccination_count
FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` dea 
JOIN `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_vaccinations` vac
  		ON dea.location = vac.location
  		AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2, 3


--The next query I want to get the percentage of the population that is vaccinated, to do this I need to use the rolling_vaccination_count column, so in order to do that I need to create a cte.

--11th query, here I created a temp table to do calculations and clean up some code, this query was to get the percentage of the population that is vaccinated by location.


WITH pop_vs_vac AS
  ( 
    SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, population,
      vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location order by dea.location, dea.date) AS rolling_vaccination_count
    FROM `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_deaths` dea
    JOIN `capstone-project-348420.guided_project.covid_vaccinations` vac
      ON dea.location = vac.location
      AND dea.date = vac.date
    WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT *, (rolling_vaccination_count / population) *100 AS percentage_vaccinated
FROM pop_vs_vac
