# PortfolioProject

Getting the Data:
Data was downloaded from Our World in Data website - https://ourworldindata.org/.
Raw data I am working with is called covid-data, from initial inspection it is all data regarding covid(infections, deaths, vaccinations, etc.) per country and continent spanning from early February 2020 to date.

Steps taken:
  1. Main .csv file that contains the dataset was split in two datasets, 1 to indicate covid deaths and one to indicate covid vaccinations.
  2. Files were then uploaded to Big Query to begin data exploration and cleaning.


Please find .csv files in repository.
